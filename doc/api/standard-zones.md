# Zones by device type #

Each device type has one or more predefined zones that will apply to all or most devices of that type (depending on exact illumination details).  For best results, it is recommended to use the `rgb-x-zone` and `rgb-per-key-zones` specifiers to handle events based on the type of lighting supported.  Using `keyboard`, `mouse`, and `indicator` is also possible but some devices will not support certain zones.

## `keyboard` ##

Note: On the Apex M800, the order of the keys in each zone is left to right and top to bottom unless otherwise specified.

* `function-keys`: F1 to F12 (Excludes MSI GE62 and GE72)
* `main-keyboard`: All keys included in the central area of the keyboard  (Excludes MSI GE62 and GE72)
* `keypad`: All keys in the numpad cluster (Excludes MSI GE62 and GE72)
* `number-keys`: 1-0 on the main keyboard area (Excludes MSI GE62 and GE72)
* `macro-keys`: The macro keys on the left side (Excludes MSI GE62 and GE72)

## `mouse` ##

* `wheel`: The mousewheel LED
* `logo`: The logo LED (excludes Sims 4 Mouse)
* `base`: The base station LED (Sensei Wireless only)

## `headset` ##

* `earcups`: The LEDs on the earcups

## `indicator` ##

* `one`: The main LED

## Static RGB zoned devices (`rgb-zoned-device` and each individual type e.g. `rgb-1-zone`) ##

Note: Each of these types supports up to the number of zones specified in its name, except `rgb-zoned-device` which can be used with any of them.
