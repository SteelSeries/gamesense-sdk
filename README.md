# SteelSeries GameSense™ SDK #
GameSense™ is a framework in SteelSeries Engine that allows games & apps
to send status updates to Engine, which can then drive illumination,
haptic & OLED display capabilities of SteelSeries devices. One simple
example would be displaying the player's health on the row of
functions keys as a bargraph that gets shorter and changes from green
to red as their health decreases -- even flashing when it gets
critically low.

This repository contains documentation, tutorials, and examples for
developers wishing to support GameSense™ in their games or
applications.

## Submitting a game or app for approval ##
### You actually don't need to submit anything to us.
Feel free to release your own app, and anyone who has your game/app installed should see it appear as a GameSense App inside of SteelSeries Engine.  We want smaller devs to be able to develop their implementation completely on their own if they so choose.

### Want to partner up and have a full curated experence for our mututal users?
Great, we do too.  [Contact us through this form](https://steelseries.com/developer/contact-us) and we'll get back to you right away.  We can add images, text, links, and other info about your project.  We can also help you with implementation, answer questions, and a lot more.

#### Project info we'll ask for:
* **Game/app title**
* **Name of your organization/company**
* **Link text & URL**
* **Short description**: for App tile, cannot exceed 200 characters
* **App tile image**: 330 pixels x 200 pixels as a PNG, containing your logo with a solid background
* **GameSense customization page image**: 200 pixels x 80 pixels as a PNG, containing your logo with a fully transparent background
