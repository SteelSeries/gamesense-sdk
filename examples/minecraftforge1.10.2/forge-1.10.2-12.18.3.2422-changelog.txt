Build 1.12-14.21.0.2349:
	LexManos: Loosen up registry locks until data freeze.

Build 1.12-14.21.0.2348:
	LexManos:
		First pass of registry rewrite. Tests do not run yet. Things of note:
		Removed the idea of substitutions, just register multiple items with the
		same name they will override each other like a normal map. Decoupled
		Forge registries from vanilla classes. They now use bouncer classes.
		MODDERS SHOULD NEVER USE THESE Introduced more stringent registry
		locking. As it sits things are only allowed to be registered during the
		RegistryEvent.Registry phases! This is to force modders to split up
		their registrations, and pave the way for calling these functions
		multiple times during a single MC lifecycle. ObjectHolder, Missing
		Mappings, etc... *should* now work for all registry types, nothing
		should be special cased to Blocks/Items anymore. Added optional generic
		dummy factory to registries, to allow registry creators the ability to
		dummy more then just Blocks. Re-worked the ItemStack transformer and
		applied it to ItemBlock and ItemBlockSpecial. Allowing us to cleanup
		reflective hacks in Block callbacks. Registry onAdd callback is now only
		fired on the ACTIVE registry, fixing any issues of temp registries
		overriding active objects.
	LexManos:
		More work, game loads and runs now. Moved Registry events to directly
		AFTER PreInit instead of before. This allows modders to register
		handlers for it without @EventBusSubscriber. It also allows you to
		register custom things needed before the construction of blocks or items
		such as Fluids. TODO: Move Fluids to a real registry. @ObjectHolder can
		now be used on private fields. Reworked FMLModIdMappingEvent to include
		data for all registries. Tile Entities are now registrable.
	LexManos: Fixup some registry tests, dummies are now persisted across syncing.
	LexManos:
		Disable substitution test, substitutions are not managed the way they
		used to be. We do not care about substitutions, People who replace
		entries should make them compatible with the existing item.
	LexManos:
		Implement override tracking and syncing. Overrides MUST be registered
		within a tracked event so we know what mod it came from. This will allow
		servers/saves to select which mod 'wins' and becomes to active entry.
		This should also mean that when connecting to a vanilla server things
		will revert.
	LexManos: Fix conflicts

		Another pass at substitutions - now capable of fixing up ItemBlock to

		opinion.

		chunk.
		 This patch ensures when ProvideChunk calls LoadChunk synchronously we

		In accordance with our stated goal of relicensing Forge to LGPL v2.1,

		such the license will take effect at that time. The three commits from
		persons who have failed to accept the new license, as documented in
		#2789, have had their commits reverted. This should complete the license
		transition. Commits after the commit date of this commit should be
		considered licensed by LGPLv2.1, as indicated in LICENSE-new.txt. All

		Fix asynchronous chunk loading (#2946)
		Since the update to Minecraft 1.9.4 chunks were actually never loaded
		asynchronously because a sync request was always made from the
		PlayerChunkMap shortly after the chunk had been queued.
		
		- PlayerChunkMapEntry now only loads chunks synchronously *after* the
		 chunk failed to load asynchronously.
		- Fixed some minor bugs that caused "Attempted to dequeue chunk"
		messages
		- Simplified ChunkProviderServer patch. loadChunk no longer generates
		chunks,

		 "hashCode abuse"

		Entities are now packed in the ChunkData packet. Forge intends to work
		around this to better support large moded worlds, but for the time being

	cpw: Two more corner cases in the oredictionary. Should work for all cases now.
	cpw:
		Fix firing the remap event. It always fires now, and additionally fires when the registry reverts to frozen.
		Most mods refer to the gameregistry for ids they care about, so this shouldn't affect anything significantly,
		but if your mod was dependent on their being content in the remap event, and only acting on that content,
		empty content means it's "reverted to frozen" state - the state at the start of the game.

Build 1.7.10-10.13.4.1541-1.7.10:

	bernhard.bonigl: Fix Potion IDs above 127

	fry: Fix for the previous commit - transparent blocks were handled improperly.
	glstillman: OBJLoader: Quick bandages to support/fix the new way that face/vertex normals are calculated, a very quick bandage to patch TextureCoordinates for the time being, and the Parser now uses a Pattern to split strings on whitespace instead of only splitting on " ".
	cpw: Fix substitutions for recipes and oredict recipes. Should mean that substitutions start working properly.

Build 1.8-11.14.3.1529:
	glstillman: Fixed a bug with item model loading that would occur if ModelBakery.addVariantName() was called with the same string location parameter for 2 different items, and the string pointed to a location that didn't exist, where ModelLoader.loadAnyModel() would substitute the blockdefinition in for the item model, but wouldn't remove the original input location from the loadingModels list, which would cause the location from the second call to throw an IllegalStateException even though that location now has a model.
	fry:
		Perspective awareness for vanilla and multi models, fixes #2148.

Added IVertexConsumer + helper classes; lighting that works correctly for non-axis-aligned faces using the new infrastructure. Changed smooth lighting algorithm, now it should work correctly for everything.
		New block lighter can be disabled in the forge config options.
	fry: Added back in the lost class

Build 1.8-11.14.3.1519:

		Fluids are now tracked internally by mod. This allows for the server and the world to specify a "default"
		in the case of a possible alternative fluid implementation. If you always called registerFluid, things
		should work pretty seamlessly, but if you didn't (gating with an isFluidRegistered check for example)
		you should change to register anyway. This way, even if you're not default in the overall instance, you may
		become default if you're the only mod present on a server, for example, or in a world save.

		Fluids are now tracked internally by mod. This allows for the server and the world to specify a "default"
		in the case of a possible alternative fluid implementation. If you always called registerFluid, things
		should work pretty seamlessly, but if you didn't (gating with an isFluidRegistered check for example)
		you should change to register anyway. This way, even if you're not default in the overall instance, you may
		become default if you're the only mod present on a server, for example, or in a world save.
		
		This should radically decrease the mixups caused by mod load ordering problems, and other issues around fluid
		tracking.

		Fix FluidRegsitry.registerFluid
		
		FluidRegistry:
		```java
		    static BiMap<String, Fluid> fluids = HashBiMap.create();
		    static BiMap<Fluid, Integer> fluidIDs = HashBiMap.create();
		...
		    public static boolean registerFluid(Fluid fluid)
		    {
		        if (fluidIDs.containsKey(fluid.getName()))
		            ^^^^^^^
		```
		There is definitely should be fluids instead fluidIDs. This mistake broke many mods.

		Removed fluidID from ItemStack.
		
		This fixes a rather huge issue where FluidStacks on the client could be desynced if a modder was unaware of it.
		
		This is a breaking change but can be mitigated with a transformer to the getter getFluidID().

	cpw:
		You shouldn't be creating FluidStacks from unregistered Fluids. Warn clearly on failed registrations, and make a useful log message for failed fluidstack

Build 1.7.10-10.13.2.1352-1.7.10:

	LexManos: Fixed domain support in ArmorMaterial texture name. Closes #1675
	LexManos: Fixed Buttons not dropping anything when broken. Closes #1676

Build 1.8-11.14.0.1296:
	LexManos:
		Initial update to 1.8, Super beta. Most rendering related hooks are out due to major changes in 1.8.
		
		Some notes:
		Almost all int x, int y, int z parameters have been changed to BlockPos class
		ForgeDirection has been removed, replaced by net.minecraft.util.EnumFacing.
		All FML classes have moved from packet cpw.mods.fml to net.minecraftforge.fml
		Fluid Rendering has been disabled for the time being, to be re-evaulated and a test mod created for it.
		Minecraft now uses a Model based system for rendering blocks and Items. The intention is to expand the model format to better suit modder's needed once it is evaulated.
		As such, The model loaders from Forge have been removed, to be replaced by expanding vanilla's model format.
		Metadata has been extracted out in Minecraft to IBlockState, which holds a list of properties instead of magic number metadata. DO NOT listen to the fearmongering, you can do EVERYTHING with block states you could previously with metadata.
		Stencil Bits are disabled entirely by for the main Display, Modders must enable and recreate the FrameBuffer if they wish to use Stencil Bits.

Build 1.7.10-10.13.1.1219:
	bloodshot:
		Added PlaceEvent and MultiPlaceEvent which fires before placing a block.
		
		Before calling "ItemStack.tryPlaceItemInWorld", a recording flag is turned on for
		setBlock to capture a blocksnapshot for each block that attempts to be placed.
		
		If 1 block is captured, a "BlockEvent.PlaceEvent" is fired to notify mods.
		If 2 or more blocks are captured, a "BlockEvent.PlaceEvent" is fired first with the first block
		captured followed by a "BlockEvent.MultiPlaceEvent" with all captured blocks. This extra event
		is required for items that have the ability to place 2 or more blocks such as a BlockBed.
		
		If either event is cancelled, the recorded block snapshot(s), item stacksize, and item meta will
		revert back to the captured snapshot(s).
		If the events are not cancelled, a notification will be sent to clients and block physics will be updated.
		
		What this means for mods is Forge will be able to capture all player block placement automatically and fire
		a PlaceEvent and/or MultiPlaceEvent.
		If for whatever reason your mod does not use the standard placement methods then you will need to fire the
		appropriate placement events in order to notify mods/servers.
		
		This commit also includes a new utility class called BlockSnapshot which is serializable. This new class is used in conjunction with
		both PlaceEvent and MultiPlaceEvent in order to record a snapshot of block space before it is altered. This
		allows us to restore the block(s) if an event is cancelled. The class also provides the ability to restore a snapshot
		to any location using the restoreToLocation method. This should be helpful to many mods that are looking to be able
		to capture block data then restore it to back to any location required.

		MinecraftForge/FML@c1b1417ee168523154a0edae68c3180814eab1c7 FML now supports passing a json formatted modlist as an argument, as well as a comma separated argument list.

	bloodshot:
		Don't call ChunkDataEvent.Load async
		
		ChunkDataEvent.Load must be called after TE's are loaded since this is
		what mods expect. The event is handled by ChunkIOProvider during
		callStage2.

Build 1.7.2-10.12.2.1123:
	bloodshot:
		Load chunks asynchronously for players.
		
		When a player triggers a chunk load via walking around or teleporting
		there is no need to stop everything and get this chunk on the main thread.
		The client is used to having to wait some time for this chunk and the
		server doesn't immediately do anything with it except send it to the
		player. At the same time chunk loading is the last major source of file IO
		that still runs on the main thread.
		
		These two facts make it possible to offload chunks loaded for this reason
		to another thread. However, not all parts of chunk loading can happen off
		the main thread. For this we use the new AsynchronousExecutor system to
		split chunk loading in to three pieces. The first is loading data from
		disk, decompressing it, and parsing it in to an NBT structure.  The second
		piece is creating entities and tile entities in the chunk and adding them
		to the world, this is still done on the main thread. The third piece is
		informing everyone who requested a chunk load that the load is finished.
		For this we register callbacks and then run them on the main thread once
		the previous two stages are finished.
		
		There are still cases where a chunk is needed immediately and these will
		still trigger chunk loading entirely on the main thread. The most obvious
		case is plugins using the API to request a chunk load. We also must load
		the chunk immediately when something in the world tries to access it. In
		these cases we ignore any possibly pending or in progress chunk loading
		that is happening asynchronously as we will have the chunk loaded by the
		time they are finished.
		
		The hope is that overall this system will result in less CPU time and
		pauses due to blocking file IO on the main thread thus giving more
		consistent performance. Testing so far has shown that this also speeds up
		chunk loading client side although some of this is likely to be because
		we are sending less chunks at once for the client to process.
		
		Thanks for ammaraskar for help with the implementation of this feature.

		MinecraftForge/FML@9f928963f20bc9bbfbe1391fb16c6f5ca5fd4344 A network design I like. It uses the netty embedded channel to allow mods to build channel pipelines on top of custom payload packets.

	LexManos: Bump version to 10.12.0 to mark 1.7.
	LexManos: Fix debug HUD rendering semi-transparently.
	LexManos: Temporary fix for items rendering with effects on one layer. Restores default vanilla rendering, which is considered a bug in modded community.

	LexManos: Fix items rendering on the GUI with invalid state due to glint rendering changing it. Thanks iChun.
	Christian:
		Updated FML:
		MinecraftForge/FML@156a9ae03a3c80bd1499a8e692c44a322ad9df62 Fix build script
		MinecraftForge/FML@7d3b1250e8368886bed0e0da350a94abaa4b6247 Fix handshaking properly. Also, fix ID syncup. It now will completely freeze the idmap after preinit. This frozen map is used to inject "new" stuff into existing serverside worlds. Interesting sideeffect: remote servers lacking things will change the client, to also LACK ids for those things. watch for -1 ids in your remap events. Note: idmaps should be considered temporary per server instance. SERVERSTOPPED will restore "startup" state, as will client logout.
	LexManos:
		MinecraftForge/FML@c180d9b15735ce89a38c497acd65fa3fab595f77 Add 1.7.2 base json, Gradle will automatically download updated versions of this. Keeping it in the repo allows us to se
		e what base json we have built our jsons off of. And if it changes update accordingly.
	LexManos: Added constructor to WorldType, and delegated the BiomeLayer management to it. Also updated the access transformer for Item/Block classes.
	LexManos: Forgot to regen patches...
	LexManos: Resize pending tile updates when it goes over the curent length. Fixed AIOOB error.
	LexManos: Add a version check mechanic to startup, it is done in a seperate thread and has a config option to compleetly disable it. This allows us to notify users of new recomended builds. Hopefully stemming the flow of outdated help request. Also adds a warning to the main screen if you are running a 'Beta' Forge. Which means a Forge for a new version of Minecraft that we have not promoted a recomended build for yet.
	LexManos: Fix dig speed on redstone ore and obsidian.
	ohai.iChun: Add render offset to event.

Packages marked as API will generate a new "modid" (the provides) that can be depended on. 2. Packages marked as API will be searched systemwide, and anything declaring that package (even without the API marker) will get an implicit dependency on the API package. 3. The API package itself will get a soft dependency on the "owner" package.

Build 1.5.1-7.7.1.632:
	LexManos:
		Pulled Biome Tag System by Emasher, Closes #433
		An issue with biome adding mods which is becoming increasingly annoying for players, is that many mod authors that add biome specific world generation or mobs in their mods, for the most part, hard code them to work with vanilla biomes only. This becomes a huge problem when it's difficult to even find a vanilla biome, let alone a specific one, when biome mods are installed.
		
		A simple solution to this problem is a tag system for biomes that allows mod authors to set up their world generators, or mobs to generate or spawn in biomes that have been registered with a specific tag such as "FOREST", or "FROZEN". I wrote such a system a few months ago, which I've been using with my own mods, and have made available to anyone who wants to use it. Since then, I've had requests from mod authors and players alike to try and get it, or at least similar functionality, into Forge, where other mod authors will be more comfortable using it.
		
		Aside from the tags, it also includes a rule based system to classify biomes that have not already been registered with it when information is requested on them (You can opt out of this by registering a biome as type "NULL"). And additionally, the ability to register IWorldGenerators for specific biomes, or biome types (tags) to speed up chunk generation a little bit.

Build 1.5.1-7.7.1.629:
	LexManos: Revert MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge@f594109b30c87f5a0996eee9e8c4513380733cee If concurancy issues arise we will reassess. The provided solution caused entities to be removed incorrectly and cause 'invisible' entities client side.

		Without this change, it is possible (and, in fact, nearly guaranteed) for lists to rebuild endlessly if a parent list is marked as needing a rebuild but never actually read.

Build 1.4.6-6.5.0.477:
	LexManos:
		Move chunk compression to the network thread in Packet 51 and 56
		
		This will reduce the server load considerably by doing the chunk data compression in writePacketData, which will be run from the network thread.
		
		The chunk compression can easily use 1/4th of the overall server thread CPU time if someone is exploring much, especially when moving quickly (e.g. with quantum leggings).

		As well as the concept of damage absorption vs reduction.

Build 1.3.2.4:
	LexManos:
		Created a Entity tracking ans spawning system.
		Mod creators should call MinecraftForge.registerEntity to register a entity.
		All entity ID numbers are Mod Unique. Meaning two mods can have Entity #1.
		Added client and server side packet handlers for the 'Forge' channel. For use in internal packets such as the new Spawn packet.
		Updated the build scripts to copy over unique server source files now that there actually are some.
		For modders:
		  If you have a entity that used MLMP's 'owner' system, you should have your entity implement IThrowableEntity
		  If you have a entity that implments MLMLP's ISpawnable, you should implement ISpawnHandler.
		They provide the same functionality, just in a cleaner, more orginized way and will be the method used when we eventually drop MLMP.
